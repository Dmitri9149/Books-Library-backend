The backend "Books Library" which I constructed while learning the course [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part8).
The backend is based on the exercises of the part 8 of the course.  
This is GraphQL backend.  

To be run with "Books" frontend which is here:  
```diff
- TODO 
+ TODO 
```
The application is the database for storing and retrieving data about books and 
books authors. Tha data are stored in MongoDB. 

Run it as 
```
npm run dev
```

And we get: 
```
Server ready at http://localhost:4000/
```
